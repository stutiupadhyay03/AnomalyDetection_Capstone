# Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Crowd Monitoring

This repository contains an interactive Streamlit app for:

1. **Avenue Dataset** – Person-centric anomaly classification using ResNet18 and YOLOv8.
2. **ShanghaiTech Dataset** – Crowd density estimation using CSRNet with YOLOv8 fallback logic for robust detection.

## 📊 Datasets Used

### 1. ShanghaiTech Dataset

**Purpose**
Originally designed for crowd counting and density estimation. Often adapted for anomaly detection and overcrowding alerts in surveillance.

**Structure**

* Part A – Dense crowds (e.g., Shanghai city streets)

  * Train: 300 annotated images
  * Test: 182 images
* Part B – Sparse crowds (e.g., parks)

  * Train: 400 annotated images
  * Test: 316 images

**Annotations**
Ground truth stored in `.mat` files containing head coordinates, converted to Gaussian density maps.

---

### 2. Avenue Dataset

**Purpose**
Designed for video anomaly detection in surveillance scenarios. Focuses on identifying unusual behaviors like running, throwing, loitering, or carrying strange objects.

**Structure**

* 16 training videos (normal behavior only)
* 21 test videos (contains anomalies)
* Resolution: 640×360 at \~25 FPS
* \~15,328 test frames

**Visual Context**
All scenes recorded from a static camera on a single pedestrian avenue in a controlled indoor/outdoor hybrid setting.

**Anomalies Include**

* People running
* Moving in abnormal directions
* Throwing items
* Carrying abnormal objects (bikes, bags, carts, etc.)

## Model Highlights

### ShanghaiTech (CSRNet-Based Crowd Counting)

* **Model:** CSRNet with VGG16 frontend and dilated convolutional backend
* **Task:** Generate density map and predict head count in static images
* **Input:** `.jpg` images
* **Ground Truth:** Annotated `.mat` files with head positions
* **Output:** Density map + total count
* **Overcrowding Alert:** Triggered if count exceeds 20
* **Metrics:**

  * Part A → MAE: 207.91, RMSE: 317.36
  * Part B → MAE: 31.18, RMSE: 66.59

### Avenue Dataset (YOLOv8 + ResNet18-Based Anomaly Classification)

* **Object Detection:** YOLOv8 to detect people and objects
* **Classification:** ResNet18 frame classifier fine-tuned to classify anomalies
* **Input:** Video frames extracted from `.avi` files
* **Labels:** Normal / Unusual Action / Abnormal Object
* **Visualization:** Bounding boxes + class label overlay
* **Performance:**

  * Original Loss: 92.17
  * Improved Loss: 68.76

## Future Limitations & Directions

### 1. Real-Time Video Stream Integration

* Integrate CCTV or webcam feeds using OpenCV/RTSP for active surveillance.
* Requires reliable edge devices and live networking, currently out of scope.

### 2. Add Temporal Awareness to ResNet

* Future versions could integrate LSTM/GRU/Transformer after ResNet for motion context.
* This adds complexity and requires GPU resources, not suitable for current CPU-only real-time constraints.

### 3. Extend Anomaly Classes

* Expand classification beyond three current labels to include:

  * Fighting/aggression
  * Climbing over barriers
  * Tailgating
  * Bicycles in pedestrian zones
  * Unauthorized group gatherings
* Requires extensive relabeling and retraining with balanced datasets.

### 4. Alert Notification System

* Enable email, SMS, or dashboard-based alerting for anomalies and overcrowding.
* Would require backend infrastructure like Twilio, SendGrid, or cloud APIs.

### 5. Edge and Cloud Deployment

* Use Jetson devices for real-time edge inference.
* Deploy on AWS, Azure, or GCP for scalable monitoring, APIs, and dashboards.
